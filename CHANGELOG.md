## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-28

### Summary

- Major release consolidating all bug fixes from the fix/bug-fixes branch.

### Fixed

- All fixes from v1.5.0 and v1.5.1 (ribbon event rendering, month view duplicates, all-day event normalisation).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Fixed ribbon events not filling full column cell width in week and workweek views — changed column alignment to left-aligned and made inner margins directional so multi-day ribbons extend edge-to-edge across adjacent day columns.
- Fixed month view showing all-day events on an extra day due to using raw end date instead of `event_display_end_date()` exclusive-end convention.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Fixed ribbon event span bug where single-day all-day events appeared to span across extra days in week and workweek views.
- Added directional corner rounding to ribbon events: first day rounds left, last day rounds right, middle days flat — making multi-day spans visually distinct from adjacent single-day events.
- Normalised all-day event storage to use midnight times and iCal exclusive-end convention, ensuring consistent span calculation across locally created and synced events.
- Fixed event dialog round-trip: loading an all-day event and re-saving no longer adds an extra day to the end date.
- Fixed ribbon resize for all-day events to correctly apply exclusive-end convention.
- Added one-shot database migration to normalise existing all-day events with non-midnight times.

## [1.4.14] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Removed redundant `source_status_message` assignment in settings dialog that triggered a clippy `unused_assignments` warning.
- Fixed CHANGELOG markdown formatting (blank lines around headings and lists) to satisfy MD022/MD032 lint rules.

### Added

- Added `.markdownlint.json` configuration with `siblings_only` for MD024 to support Keep a Changelog duplicate headings.

## [1.4.13] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Constrained month-view event chip titles to a single line with width-aware truncation to prevent text overflow across cells.
- Improved month-view right-click interaction so event context menus reliably target the clicked event chip.
- Normalised countdown creation timing for non-recurring multi-day events by resolving canonical event start/end from persistence at countdown-consumption time, ensuring countdowns begin from the first day regardless of where the event was clicked in month/week/workweek views.

## [1.4.12] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Added a configurable Google sync startup delay setting (default 15 minutes) in Settings, persisted in the database and applied when creating the sync scheduler on app launch.

### Changed

- Extended synced-event filtering to support source-scoped behaviour across day/week/workweek/month views.
- Updated filtering semantics so selecting a source with synced-only disabled shows that source's synced events plus local non-synced events (for example, Den + local).
- Added source-scoped synced ID lookup support in sync mapping services to back view-level filtering and lock/read-only guard behaviour.

## [1.4.11] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Unified countdown creation behaviour across day/week/workweek/month/search event surfaces via shared countdown menu-state logic and request handling.
- Added synced-event metadata enrichment for countdown cards by composing description, location, and synced source labels through the existing countdown request pipeline.
- Added one-click countdown creation in Search dialog flows and made synced search results countdown-first (read-only edit disabled, countdown action surfaced directly).
- Extended sync mapping lookups to resolve source names by local event for consistent synced countdown labelling.

## [1.4.10] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Reworked week/workweek ribbon layout into stable lane-based rendering so all-day event rows stay consistently aligned across day columns.
- Fixed week view column width calculation to account for scrollbar width, keeping ribbon/header column boundaries aligned with the time grid.
- Constrained ribbon event title rendering to lane width with truncation to prevent long titles from overflowing columns and shifting neighbouring event blocks.
- Normalised ribbon lane slot sizing and top anchoring to remove vertical baseline drift introduced by mixed text/content sizing.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Aligned week/workweek ribbon rules to show only all-day events (single-day and multi-day), removing timed-event spillover from the ribbon row.
- Normalised all-day display end-date handling in week/workweek ribbon rendering so exclusive ICS `DTEND` values do not render one extra day.
- Fixed ICS import for events missing `DTEND` by deriving sane defaults from `DTSTART` (timed: +1 hour, all-day: +1 day), preventing malformed multi-year spans from appearing in current weeks.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Tightened `🔒 Synced only` filtering so it includes synced events from enabled calendar sources only.
- Fixed recurrence `RRULE` `UNTIL` parsing to handle datetime forms (for example `UNTIL=20210103T023000Z`), preventing expired series from being expanded as active events.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Made scheduled Google Calendar sync fully non-blocking for the UI by running scheduler ticks on a background worker with async result polling.
- Made manual `Sync Now` in Settings non-blocking with worker-thread execution and in-dialog progress/result handling.
- Reduced UI-thread overhead by removing high-frequency layout debug logs and throttling scheduler polling/repaint cadence to improve responsiveness.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- New view-level `🔒 Synced only` toggle to show only read-only events imported from calendar sync sources, improving parity checks against Google Calendar during QA.

### Changed

- Improved ICS import robustness for Google feeds by correctly parsing date-only `EXDATE;VALUE=DATE` entries.
- Improved startup UX by delaying the first automatic background sync shortly after app launch, reducing perceived startup lag.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 S7 scheduler and hardening:
  - New background calendar sync scheduler with per-source poll interval handling.
  - Per-source failure isolation so one failing source does not block others.
  - Retry/backoff policy for failing sources with capped delay.
  - Scheduler diagnostics and tests covering interval behaviour, failure isolation, and redaction.

### Changed

- Wired scheduler execution into the app update loop for automatic periodic sync.
- Hardened sync error handling to redact source ICS URLs from stored/propagated error messages.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 S6 synced event read-only protections and visual marking:
  - Synced events now show a lock marker (`🔒`) in day/week/workweek/month event rendering.
  - Synced events now include explicit read-only tooltip/context-menu messaging.
  - Added shared synced-event lookup helpers for UI enforcement paths.

### Changed

- Blocked local edit/delete/move/resize operations for synced events across day/week/workweek/month interactions.
- Added app-level guardrails so synced events cannot be opened for editing from alternate entry points (search, dialog flows, confirmations).
- Added save-time protection and regression tests to prevent synced event updates from dialog state.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 S5 settings UI controls for Google Calendar read-only sync:
  - Add source form (name, private ICS URL, poll interval).
  - Per-source update/delete actions.
  - Manual “Sync now” action with sync result feedback.
  - Status display for last sync outcome and last error.

### Changed

- Added persistent settings dialog UI state so source drafts can be edited safely across frames.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 S4 sync engine foundations:
  - New `CalendarSyncEngine` orchestration for per-source sync runs and batch sync across enabled sources.
  - Source-scoped upsert by (`source_id`, `external_uid`) using `event_sync_map` identity mapping.
  - Deletion reconciliation for mapped events not present in the latest feed payload.
  - Sync run result counters for created/updated/deleted/skipped events.

### Changed

- Extended mapping service with source listing support used by reconciliation (`list_by_source_id`).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 S3 sync pipeline improvements:
  - New cross-platform ICS fetcher (`reqwest` + `rustls`) with timeout, retries, payload size guard, and URL redaction for logs.
  - Metadata-aware ICS import path that captures event `UID` and raw `LAST-MODIFIED` while preserving existing event import APIs.

### Changed

- Improved iCalendar datetime parsing to better handle UTC (`Z`) and `TZID` forms, reducing timezone interpretation issues across Windows and Linux.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stage 1 Google Calendar read-only sync foundations:
  - New `calendar_sources` persistence model, validation, and CRUD service for managing multiple Google ICS feeds.
  - New `event_sync_map` model and table with unique (`source_id`, `external_uid`) mapping for deterministic external identity tracking.
  - New `EventSyncMapService` methods for mapping create/lookup/touch/delete operations.
- New schema coverage and service tests for `calendar_sources` and `event_sync_map` tables and mapping behaviour.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- TCTBP status workflow now includes explicit next-step recommendations (for example `handback`, `handoff`, `ship`, `abort`, or `none`) based on repo state.
- Test code was refactored to satisfy strict clippy checks by using struct initialisers with `..Default::default()` instead of field reassignment after default construction.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Removed

- **Compact mode** from countdown cards — the setting was wired through the UI, database, and service layers but never actually affected rendering. Removed the field from the data model, all SQL queries, the countdown settings dialog, the event editor dialog, and the service API. The database column is retained with its default value to avoid a migration.

## [1.0.21] - 2025-11-29

### Added

  - Supports: Create Event, Update Event, Delete Event
  - History limit of 50 operations
  - 6 new unit tests for command system

### Changed

  - Right-click on empty space in Month, Week, or Day view to see "📋 From Template" submenu
  - Templates listed with hover tooltips showing title and duration
  - Clicking a template creates an event for that specific date/time

### Fixed

- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - View shortcuts (D, M, W, K) no longer interfere while typing:
  - Fixed issue where pressing 'd', 'm', 'w' etc. would change views while typing in dialogs
  - Shortcuts now properly detect when a text input has focus

## [1.0.15] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **Event Templates** - Save and reuse common event configurations:
  - Templates submenu in Events menu with quick access to saved templates

  - Database table `event_templates` for persistent storage

## [1.0.14] - 2025-11-28

### Added
